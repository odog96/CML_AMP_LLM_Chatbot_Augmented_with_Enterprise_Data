Then he ripped open Hermiones letter and read it out loud Dear Ron, and Harry if youre there, I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you didnt do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that would get Harry into trouble, too. Ive been really worried and if Harry is all right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl, because I think another delivery might finish your one off. Im very busy with schoolwork, of course How can she be? said Ron in horror. Were on vacation! and were going to London next Wednesday to buy my new books. Why dont we meet in Diagon Alley? Let me know whats happening as soon as you can. Love from Hermione. Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too, said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table. Whatre you all up to today? P a g e 51 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling Harry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned. It was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they could practice Quidditch there, as long as they didnt fly too high. They couldnt use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village instead they threw apples for one another to catch. They took turns riding Harrys Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom Rons old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies. Five minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks over their shoulders. They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them, but he had said he was busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so far he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time. Wish I knew what he was up to, said Fred, frowning. Hes not himself. His exam results came the day before you did twelve O.W.L.s and he hardly gloated at all. Ordinary Wizarding Levels, George explained, seeing Harrys puzzled look. Bill got twelve, too. If were not careful, well have another Head Boy in the family. I dont think I could stand the shame. Bill was the oldest Weasley brother. He and the next brother, Charlie, had already left Hogwarts. Harry had never met either of them, but knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt working for the wizards bank, Gringotts. Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year, said George after a while. Five sets of Lockhart books! And Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything. P a g e 52 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling Harry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward.
