Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag. Harry felt even worse when they reached his vault. He tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag. Back outside on the marble steps, they all separated. Percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill. Fred and George had spotted their friend from Hogwarts, Lee Jordan. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop. Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink. Well all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks, said Mrs. Weasley, setting off with Ginny. And not one step down Knockturn Alley! she shouted at the twins retreating backs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the winding, cobbled street. The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully in Harrys pocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought three large strawberryandpeanutbutter ice creams, which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating shop windows. Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until Hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door. In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibusters Fabulous Wet Start, NoHeat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy, P a g e 65 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power. A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers, Ron read aloud off the back cover. That sounds fascinating. Go away, Percy snapped. Course, hes very ambitious, Percy, hes got it all planned out. He wants to be Minister of Magic Ron told Harry and Hermione in an undertone as they left Percy to it. An hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts. They were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop. As they approached it, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors, trying to get in. The reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows GILDEROY LOCKHART will be signing copies of his autobiography MAGICAL ME today 1230 p.m. to 430 p.m. We can actually meet him! Hermione squealed. I mean, hes written almost the whole booklist! The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs. Weasleys age. A harassedlooking wizard stood at the door, saying, Calmly, please, ladies. Dont push, there mind the books, now. Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed inside. A long line wound right to the back of the shop, where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books.
