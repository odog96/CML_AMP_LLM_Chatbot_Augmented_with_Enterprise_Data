Harry could make out Hermiones neat P a g e 21 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling writing, Rons untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid. Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry. Harry Potter mustnt be angry. Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir. Harry wasnt listening. He made a grab for the letters, but Dobby jumped out of reach. Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his word that he will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this is a danger you must not face! Say you wont go back, sir! No, said Harry angrily. Give me my friends letters! Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice, said the elf sadly. Before Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the bedroom door, pulled it open, and sprinted down the stairs. Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, trying not to make a sound. He jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on the hall carpet, looking around for Dobby. From the dining room he heard Uncle Vernon saying, tell Petunia that very funny story about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. Shes been dying to hear Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear. P a g e 22 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling Aunt Petunias masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream and sugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling. On top of a cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby. No, croaked Harry. Please theyll kill me. Harry Potter must say hes not going back to school Dobby please Say it, sir I cant Dobby gave him a tragic look. Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potters own good. The pudding fell to the floor with a heartstopping crash. Cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. With a crack like a whip, Dobby vanished. There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunias pudding. At first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over. Just our nephew very disturbed meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs. He shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop. Aunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer P a g e 23 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling and Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing the kitchen clean. Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal if it hadnt been for the owl.
