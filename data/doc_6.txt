May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason? The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long, thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm and legholes. Er hello, said Harry nervously. Harry Potter! said the creature in a highpitched voice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs. So P a g e 14 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K.
