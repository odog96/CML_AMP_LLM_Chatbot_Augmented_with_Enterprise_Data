but thought it would sound too rude, so instead he said, Who are you? Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the houseelf, said the creature. Oh really? said Harry. Er I dont want to be rude or anything, but this isnt a great time for me to have a houseelf in my bedroom. Aunt Petunias high, false laugh sounded from the living room. The elf hung his head. Not that Im not pleased to meet you, said Harry quickly, but, er, is there any particular reason youre here? Oh, yes, sir, said Dobby earnestly. Dobby has come to tell you, sir it is difficult, sir Dobby wonders where to begin. Sit down, said Harry politely, pointing at the bed. To his horror, the elf burst into tears very noisy tears. Ssit down! he wailed. Never never ever Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter. Im sorry, he whispered, I didnt mean to offend you or anything P a g e 15 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling Offend Dobby! choked the elf. Dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard like an equal Harry, trying to say Shh! and look comforting at the same time, ushered Dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, looking like a large and very ugly doll. At last he managed to control himself, and sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery adoration. You cant have met many decent wizards, said Harry, trying to cheer him up. Dobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window, shouting, Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby! Dont what are you doing? Harry hissed, springing up and pulling Dobby back onto the bed Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage. Dobby had to punish himself, sir, said the elf, who had gone slightly crosseyed. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir. Your family? The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is a houseelf bound to serve one house and one family forever. Do they know youre here? asked Harry curiously. Dobby shuddered. P a g e 16 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling Oh, no, sir, no Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this. If they ever knew, sir But wont they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door? Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for something, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments. But why dont you leave? Escape? A houseelf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set Dobby free Dobby will serve the family until he dies, sir. Harry stared.
