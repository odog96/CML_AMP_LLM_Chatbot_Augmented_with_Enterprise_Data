The Chudley Cannons, said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread, which was emblazoned with two giant black Cs and a speeding cannonball. Ninth in the league. P a g e 46 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling Rons school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle. Rons magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat, Scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun. Harry stepped over a pack of SelfShuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window. In the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys hedge. Then he turned to look at Ron, who was watching him almost nervously, as though waiting for his opinion. Its a bit small, said Ron quickly. Not like that room you had with the Muggles. And Im right underneath the ghoul in the attic hes always banging on the pipes and groaning. But Harry, grinning widely, said, This is the best house Ive ever been in. Rons ears went pink. P a g e 47 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS Life at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive.

Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, Tuck your shirt in, scruffy! The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and Georges bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Rons, however, wasnt the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him. Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked. P a g e 48 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling Fascinating! he would say as Harry talked him through using a telephone. Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic. Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table. The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter.
