This didnt help, as Harry had never heard of such a place. He supposed he hadnt spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the Weasleys fire. Trying to stay calm, he wondered what to do. Not lost are you, my dear? said a voice in his ear, making him jump. An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails. She leered at him, showing mossy teeth. Harry backed away. Im fine, thanks, he said.

How come yeh never wrote back ter me? said Hagrid as Harry jogged alongside him he had to take three steps to every stride of Hagrids enormous boots. Harry explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys. Lousy Muggles, growled Hagrid. If Idve known Harry! Harry! Over here! Harry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts. She ran down to meet them, her bushy brown hair flying behind her. What happened to your glasses? Hello, Hagrid Oh, its wonderful to see you two again Are you coming into Gringotts, Harry? As soon as Ive found the Weasleys, said Harry. P a g e 62 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K.
