And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harry felt. He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master, the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his fourposter bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks. P a g e 4 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling All Harrys spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and topoftheline Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because he hadnt practiced all summer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework done? The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles not a drop of magical blood in their veins, and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harrys owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world. Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache Aunt Petunia was horsefaced and bony Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jetblack hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin, lightningshaped scar. It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harrys very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys doorstep eleven years before. At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harrys parents had died in Voldemorts attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow nobody understood why Voldemorts powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry. P a g e 5 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling So Harry had been brought up by his dead mothers sister and her husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents.
