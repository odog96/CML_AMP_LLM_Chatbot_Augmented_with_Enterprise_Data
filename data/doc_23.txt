Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun. Pretending he hadnt noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. Weasley offered him. Letters from school, said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink. Dumbledore already knows youre here, Harry doesnt miss a trick, that man. You twove got them, too, he added, as Fred and George ambled in, still in their pajamas. For a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters. Harrys told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from Kings Cross station on September first. There was also a list of the new books hed need for the coming year. SECONDYEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 by Miranda Goshawk Break with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart Gadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart P a g e 49 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling Holidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart Travels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart Voyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart Wanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart Year with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart Fred, who had finished his own list, peered over at Harrys. Youve been told to get all Lockharts books, too! he said. The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan bet its a witch. At this point, Fred caught his mothers eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade. That lot wont come cheap, said George, with a quick look at his parents. Lockharts books are really expensive. Well, well manage, said Mrs. Weasley, but she looked worried. I expect well be able to pick up a lot of Ginnys things secondhand. Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year? Harry asked Ginny. She nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put her elbow in the butter dish. Fortunately no one saw this except Harry, because just then Rons elder brother Percy walked in. He was already dressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest. Morning, all, said Percy briskly. Lovely day. P a g e 50 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K.

Errol! said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting a letter from under its wing. Finally hes got Hermiones answer. I wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys. He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it, but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron laid him on the draining board instead, muttering, Pathetic.
