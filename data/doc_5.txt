Rowling glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadnt all been a dream. Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of last term, Harry had come facetoface with none other than Lord Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemorts clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been staring absentmindedly into the hedge and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves. Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn. I know what day it is, sang Dudley, waddling toward him. The huge eyes blinked and vanished. What? said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been. I know what day it is, Dudley repeated, coming right up to him. Well done, said Harry. So youve finally learned the days of the week. P a g e 10 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling Todays your birthday, sneered Dudley. How come you havent got any cards? Havent you even got friends at that freak place? Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school, said Harry coolly. Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat bottom. Whyre you staring at the hedge? he said suspiciously. Im trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire, said Harry. Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face. You ccant Dad told you youre not to do mmagic he said hell chuck you out of the house and you havent got anywhere else to go you havent got any friends to take you Jiggery pokery! said Harry in a fierce voice. Hocus pocus squiggly wiggly MUUUUUUM! howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house. MUUUUM! Hes doing you know what! Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadnt really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldnt eat again until hed finished. P a g e 11 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench.
