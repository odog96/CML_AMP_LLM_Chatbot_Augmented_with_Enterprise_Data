Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldnt see him laughing. And you, boy? Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged. Ill be in my room, making no noise and pretending Im not there, he said. Too right, you will, said Uncle Vernon forcefully. The Masons dont know anything about you and its going to stay that way.
