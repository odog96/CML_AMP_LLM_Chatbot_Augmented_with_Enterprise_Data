This is a symbolic AI approach, not because the words symbolize anything after all grammar does not have to come with mean 3httpslivehucmsa222.pantheonsite.io 4httpaitpconference.org2023 5This challenge originates with Turings famous test, but the restriction to question answer ing makes it better defined and testable using benchmarks, standardized questionanswer sets. Discussion of the original test can be found at httpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiTuring test 6Symbolic AI is sometimes called GOFAI for good oldfashioned AI. Related terms include rule based, logic based, expert system and feature engineering. The con nectionist approach has many other names, reflecting its mixed ancestry neural, deep learning, parallel distributed processing, differentiable, and representation learning. 4 ing, but because the grammatical rules and the parsing algorithm including its internal data structures have a clear meaning to their designers. Symbolic methods have had considerable success at many tasks requiring intelligence, famously including chess playing 60 and symbolic algebra7 as well as more prosaic but very central tasks such as translating high level computer languages to machine code compiling. And a great deal of work has been done to broaden their scope, for example to build question answering systems such as the well known IBM Watson. Many valuable techniques came out of this ways to systematize rules into knowledge bases or knowledge graphs, methods for automated logical reasoning, and so on. But it was long ago realized that once one goes beyond formal worlds such as chess and algebra to the complex and messy situations of real life, although one can postulate rules which capture many truths and can be used for reasoning, rules which are valid in all cases are very rare. Furthermore, the sheer number of rules required to cover even the likely possibilities is very large. These difficulties were addressed by implementing probabilistic reasoning and by getting teams of humans to develop the requisite enormous rule sets, leading to the expert system approach which was applied for example to medical question answering. Cyc,8 an early and well known expert system, is commercially available and has a database of commonly known facts with over 25 million assertions however this is dwarfed by knowledge bases such as Wikidata over one billion facts but which do It is clear that any approach which not have a systematic reasoning engine. depends on careful human analysis of such large knowledge bases is impractical. Meanwhile, a very different connectionist approach to AI was being cham pioned by other researchers. They drew their inspiration from hypotheses about how the brain works, from information theory and statistics, from physics and other natural sciences, and from applied mathematics and particularly opti mization theory. These diverse points of view came together in the 1990s and led to a great deal of interdisciplinary work,9 of which the part most related to AI and which lies behind LLMs is called machine learning ML. The usual starting point in modern treatments of ML is to rephrase a task as a statistical inference problem based on a large dataset.
