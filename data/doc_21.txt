Rowling Mrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. Mr. Weasleys eyes jerked open. He stared guiltily at his wife. Ccars, Molly, dear? Yes, Arthur, cars, said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes flashing. Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was enchanting it to make it fly. Mr. Weasley blinked. Well, dear, I think youll find that he would be quite within the law to do that, even if er he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth. Theres a loophole in the law, youll find. As long as he wasnt intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly wouldnt Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law! shouted Mrs. Weasley. Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed! And for your information, Harry arrived this morning in the car you werent intending to fly! Harry? said Mr. Weasley blankly. Harry who? He looked around, saw Harry, and jumped. Good lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet you, Rons told us so much about Your sons flew that car to Harrys house and back last night! shouted Mrs. Weasley. What have you got to say about that, eh? P a g e 45 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling Did you really? said Mr. Weasley eagerly. Did it go all right? I I mean, he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs. Weasleys eyes, that that was very wrong, boys very wrong indeed. Lets leave them to it, Ron muttered to Harry as Mrs. Weasley swelled like a bullfrog. Come on, Ill show you my bedroom. They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging up through the house. On the third landing, a door stood ajar. Harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap. Ginny, said Ron. You dont know how weird it is for her to be this shy. She never shuts up normally They climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it, saying RONALDS ROOM. Harry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and blinked. It was like walking into a furnace Nearly everything in Rons room seemed to be a violent shade of orange the bedspread, the walls, even the ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks, and waving energetically. Your Quidditch team? said Harry.
