upgrade the       cluster software across an entire cluster using Cloudera Parcels. Package-based installations are not supported 
for Cloudera Runtime and CDP Private Cloud Base upgrades. You must transition your CDH clusters to use Parcels before upgrading 
to CDP Private Cloud Base. See Migrating from Packages to       Parcels . Cluster upgrades update the Hadoop software and other 
components. You can use Cloudera Manager to upgrade a cluster for major, minor, and maintenance upgrades. The procedures vary 
depending on the version of Cloudera Manager you are using, the version of the cluster you are upgrading, and the version of 
Cloudera Runtime you are upgrading to. After completing preparatory steps, you use the Cloudera Manager upgrade wizard to complete 
the upgrade. Cloudera Manager will restart all services       after the upgrade. Step 1: Getting Started Upgrading a Cluster
