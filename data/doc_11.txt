Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped a letter on Mrs. Masons head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke. Harry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a demonic glint in his tiny eyes. Read it! he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had delivered. Go on read it! Harry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings. Dear Mr. Potter, We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine. As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C. We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non P a g e 24 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling magical community Muggles is a serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks Statute of Secrecy. Enjoy your holidays! Yours sincerely, Mafalda Hopkirk IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE Ministry of Magic Harry looked up from the letter and gulped. You didnt tell us you werent allowed to use magic outside school, said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes. Forgot to mention it. Slipped your mind, I daresay. He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teeth bared. Well, Ive got news for you, boy. Im locking you up. Youre never going back to that school never and if you try and magic yourself out theyll expel you! And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs. Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harrys window. He himself fitted a catflap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock. P a g e 25 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling Three days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, and Harry couldnt see any way out of his situation. He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him. What was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwarts would expel him for doing it?
