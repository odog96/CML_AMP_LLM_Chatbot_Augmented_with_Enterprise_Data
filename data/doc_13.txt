Ive asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came home and said youd got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles It wasnt me and how did he know? He works for the Ministry, said Ron. You know were not supposed to do spells outside school P a g e 28 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling You should talk, said Harry, staring at the floating car. Oh, this doesnt count, said Ron. Were only borrowing this. Its Dads, we didnt enchant it. But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with I told you, I didnt but itll take too long to explain now look, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and wont let me come back, and obviously I cant magic myself out, because the Ministryll think thats the second spell Ive done in three days, so Stop gibbering, said Ron. Weve come to take you home with us. But you cant magic me out either We dont need to, said Ron, jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning. You forget who Ive got with me. Tie that around the bars, said Fred, throwing the end of a rope to Harry. If the Dursleys wake up, Im dead, said Harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car. Dont worry, said Fred, and stand back. Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent. The car revved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the bars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the P a g e 29 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling ground. Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car. Harry listened anxiously, but there was no sound from the Dursleys bedroom. When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversed as close as possible to Harrys window. Get in, Ron said. But all my Hogwarts stuff my wand my broomstick Where is it? Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I cant get out of this room No problem, said George from the front passenger seat. Out of the way, Harry. Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harrys room. You had to hand it to them, thought Harry, as George took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock. A lot of wizards think its a waste of time, knowing this sort of Muggle trick, said Fred, but we feel theyre skills worth learning, even if they are a bit slow. There was a small click and the door swung open.
