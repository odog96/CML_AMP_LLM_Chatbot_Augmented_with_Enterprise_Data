So well get your trunk you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to Ron, whispered George. Watch out for the bottom stair it creaks, Harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing. P a g e 30 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling Harry dashed around his room, collecting his things and passing them out of the window to Ron. Then he went to help Fred and George heave his trunk up the stairs. Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough. At last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunk through Harrys room to the open window. Fred climbed back into the car to pull with Ron, and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom side. Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window. Uncle Vernon coughed again. A bit more, panted Fred, who was pulling from inside the car. One good push Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car. Okay, lets go, George whispered. But as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him, followed immediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernons voice. THAT RUDDY OWL! Ive forgotten Hedwig! Harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on he snatched up Hedwigs cage, dashed to the window, and passed it out to Ron. He was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when Uncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open. P a g e 31 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K.

Ron, Fred, and George seized Harrys arms and pulled as hard as they could. Petunia! roared Uncle Vernon. Hes getting away! HES GETTING AWAY! But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harrys leg slid out of Uncle Vernons grasp Harry was in the car hed slammed the door shut Put your foot down, Fred! yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenly toward the moon. Harry couldnt believe it he was free. He rolled down the window, the night air whipping his hair, and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harrys window. See you next summer! Harry yelled. The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat, grinning from ear to ear. Let Hedwig out, he told Ron. She can fly behind us. She hasnt had a chance to stretch her wings for ages. George handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment later, Hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost. So whats the story, Harry? said Ron impatiently. Whats been happening?
