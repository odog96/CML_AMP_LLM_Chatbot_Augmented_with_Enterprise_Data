THE WORST BIRTHDAY Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew Harrys room. Third time this week! he roared across the table. If you cant control that owl, itll have to go! Harry tried, yet again, to explain. Shes bored, he said. Shes used to flying around outside. If I could just let her out at night Do I look stupid? snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache. I know whatll happen if that owls let out. He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia. Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys son, Dudley. P a g e 2 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling I want more bacon. Theres more in the frying pan, sweetums, said Aunt Petunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son. We must build you up while weve got the chance. I dont like the sound of that school food. Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings, said Uncle Vernon heartily. Dudley gets enough, dont you, son? Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry. Pass the frying pan. Youve forgotten the magic word, said Harry irritably. The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in his temples. I meant please! said Harry quickly. I didnt mean WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU, thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the table, ABOUT SAYING THE M WORD IN OUR HOUSE? But I HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY! roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist. P a g e 3 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling I just I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF! Harry stared from his purplefaced uncle to his pale aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet. All right, said Harry, all right Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes. Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry Potter wasnt a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be. Harry Potter was a wizard a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
