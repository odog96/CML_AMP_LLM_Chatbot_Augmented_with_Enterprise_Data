And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his scar were famous but now the school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly. The Dursleys hadnt even remembered that today happened to be Harrys twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadnt been high theyd never given him a real present, let alone a cake but to ignore it completely At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said, Now, as we all know, today is a very important day. Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it. This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career, said Uncle Vernon. Harry went back to his toast.

Ill be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending Im not there, said Harry tonelessly. Exactly, said Uncle Vernon nastily. I will lead them into the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour them drinks. At eightfifteen Ill announce dinner, said Aunt Petunia. And, Dudley, youll say May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason? said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman. My perfect little gentleman! sniffed Aunt Petunia. And you? said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry. Ill be in my room, making no noise and pretending Im not there, said Harry dully. P a g e 7 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K.

Do tell me where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason. Perfect Dudley? How about We had to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.
