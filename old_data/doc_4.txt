7 Table of Contents In September 2023, we entered into a Term Loan with a group of banks for an unsecured 800.0 term facility. Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest on the prevailing Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR and are payable at the end of the borrowing term. The Term Loan matures on November 7, 2026, and does not require scheduled amortization payments. Voluntary prepayments are permitted without premium or penalty. As of October 31, 2023, no balance was drawn on the Term Loan. On November 7, 2023, the full amount was drawn on the Term Loan at an interest rate of 6.67 percent, to partially finance the acquisition of Hostess Brands, as discussed in Note 3 Acquisition. Capitalized debt issuance costs associated with the Term Loan will be amortized to interest expense net on the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Income over the time period for which the debt is outstanding. In September 2023, we entered into a commitment letter for a 5.2 billion Bridge Loan that provided committed financing for the acquisition of Hostess Brands, as disclosed in Note 3 Acquisition. No balances were drawn against this facility, as the commitment letter was terminated after completion of the Senior Notes offering and drawing on the Term Loan. Included in other debt costs on the Condensed Statement of Consolidated Income at October 31, 2023, was 19.5 related to financing fees associated with the Bridge Loan. In October 2023, we completed an offering of 3.5 billion in Senior Notes due November 15, 2028, November 15, 2033, November 15, 2043, and November 15, 2053. The Senior Notes included 29.5 of capitalized debt issuance costs and 15.0 of offering discounts to be amortized to interest expense net on the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Income over the time period for which the debt is outstanding. The net proceeds from the offering were used to partially finance the acquisition of Hostess Brands. All of our Senior Notes outstanding at October 31, 2023, are unsecured and interest is paid semiannually, with no required scheduled principal payments until maturity. We may prepay all or part of the Senior Notes at 100 percent of the principal amount thereof, together with the accrued and unpaid interest, and any applicable makewhole amount. We have available a 2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of 11 banks that matures in August 2026. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest on the prevailing U.S. Prime Rate, SOFR, Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or Canadian Dealer Offered Rate, based on our election. Interest is payable either on a quarterly basis or at the end of the borrowing term. We did not have a balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility at October 31, 2023, or April 30, 2023. We participate in a commercial paper program under which we can issue shortterm, unsecured commercial paper not to exceed 2.0 billion at any time.
