is GA as of CML PvC 1.5.1. Official migration documentation is here. CDSW and CML PvC need to be installed on top of the same CDP Base cluster for the tool to recognize that CDSW cluster is there. CDSW 1.10.0+ is required. Field-facing slides for CDSW to CML PvC upgrade. Also note that single-node deployment of CDSW can potentially be moved to CML single-node (including ECS services and CML sharing a node). As of August 2023 there is now a CLI tool (cmlutils) that can migrate projects from CDSW 1.10.0+ to CML Public Cloud. Soon this tool will also be able to do project-by-project migrations to CML Private Cloud. More detailed information on CDSW to CML project migration. How to handle an IoT use case with a model at the edge? Answer: Youll need 2 components: CML and Edge Manager (w/ MiNiFi). Model can be trained with CML and the model artifact can be pushed to the edge devices MiNiFi agent. For a demo, watch Andre Sousa Dantas De Araujos video (link to vid). Why does CML Job not error out (), while there is an error in it? Answer: If you are running shell commands, either with ! magic or python subprocess, and there are errors in these commands, your CML job will return successfully - no failure notification. To force the job to fail, you can do it like this: subprocess.run(["mkdir", "-p", f"{BKUP_DIR}"], check=True). Notice the check=True, that will return a failure to the control process which will result in the job . How to size GPU for LLM apps? Answer: There is no exact answer. Some Slack discussion is available here. FAQ and reference architecture docs are in the works. How to fix session timeout? Answer: Session timeouts, for legacy Engines and ML Runtimes, are governed by Environment Variables. Specifically you are looking for IDLE_MAXIMUM_MINUTES and SESSION_MAXIMUM_MINUTES. Important note: idle time only applies to Workbench sessions (including PBJ), and does not apply to any custom editors (e.g. Jupyter). If you would like to time out custom editor sessions after some time (regardless of inactivity), you will need to set SESSION_MAXIMUM_MINUTES lower than the current default of 7 days. Values for these variables can be set at Site Administrator level (see Site Administration > Runtime/Engine and scroll down to Environment variables). The usual way to set up variables for a project will also work, but will only apply to that project. RedHat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) How do we size hardware for CML on OCP? Answer: Step 1: Review CML (OpenShift) requirements with customer and make sure they have all of it addressed, and CML worker is minimum 16vCPUx32GB (size of a laptop) Step 2: Give some general guidance based on customer needs: per team member, you should allow for 48 GB and 12 CPU and then some kind overhead for smaller teams. i.e, a team of 1 will probably need 3 x that, but a team of 20 will be fine. Step 3: Does customer expect to
